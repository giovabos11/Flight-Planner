# Flight Planner

## Abstract

Using information on flights including the duration, cost, and carrier, determine all possible itineraries for a person wishing to travel between two different cities serviced by an airline (assuming a path exists). For each of these possible itineraries, calculate the total cost and time incurred.

## Additional Features

String, linked list, adjacency, and queue classes were implemented from scratch, and test cases where created to check the functionality of the classes.
